settle on a common way to identify buttons: make all methods accept lower-case
hex strings

get stty settings right

get reset sequence right, sometimes it doesn't work

clean up buttonmaster.pl: I'm pretty slow at this Gtk stuff

add TMEX layer (represent a button as a small filesystem)

consider adding interface code for the Java button. The interface is pretty
tricky (looking over the dallas code, it seems to require multiple
transactions to get the whole APDU into the button, then various polling
schemes to wait for the operation to finish, then multiple transactions to get
it out again). If the licensing issues aren't a problem, it may be a lot
easier to write a perl wrapper around the dallas 'capi' library than to
reimplement the [undocumented] protocol in perl.
